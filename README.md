Scenario
You work for Creative Technology Solutions (CTS) as a Technology Consultant
For this the client was Gaming Room.
They wanted to exapnd their software to other operating systems.
I was able to clearly explain the pros and cons of each availble operating system and what would be good for their application.
When writing this document it helps when coding to keep on track and know exactly what you will need to implement before even attempting it.
If I were to revise this I would explain things a bit more througly in the later entries of the document.
When considering The Gaming Room wanted enough space for all their media, this was something helpful for me to focus on and help me explain to them the best course of action.
Since the document already specified everything that needed to be implemented and worked out it was easy to focus on one requirement then on to the next.
